```
	* description
		Is an external extension project based on the spark receiver component. 
		This project solves spark's problem of reading log files generated by 
		logback in real time. The core of this project is the spring AOP and spark
		components and the Logback components. Users can feel the elegance and 
		convenience of spark's streaming computing, which allows them to capture
		aspects of AOP connectivity in real time and conveniently perform calculations 
		that conform to their company's business logic, just by implementing the 
		necessary abstract methods.
